Klaverjas
=========

An unfinished Klaverjas game - somewhat functional, though there's no real AI and calculations of score might be incorrect.

I'm not sure I will finish this project. For one: rewriting the app in C# with Xamarin seems more tempting, since I'll be able to release the app more easily on multiple platforms. Additionally, I'm not sure if the current implementation works very well UI wise, but I can't figure out a better solution at the moment.
